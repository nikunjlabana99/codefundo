Create an app for prevention and management for natural disasters(flood, earthquake or hurricane).

the idea for an app:-
During and after natural disasters situation is very tough to handle. In our app, there is two type of user one is common people and second is a rescue team.

common people add family member to it and during natural disasters they can locate other family members and they can send their location and locate last active location so they easily find their family member and rescue them.they can find safe place via rescue team and if a situation is very bad then they can send their location to rescue team so they get help from the rescue team as fast as possible. our app also provides first aid technique to rescue themselves from natural disasters.
Using our app rescue team find people and provides help as fast as possible and give them instruction to prevent from that particular situation.
So basically our app is for finding their family member and get help from the rescue team as fast as possible.
